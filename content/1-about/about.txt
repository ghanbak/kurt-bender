My full name is Kurt Douglas Bender and I grew up near Chicago the third of eight children. Because of the similarity between my name and that of the famed Spartacus actor, Kirk Douglas, I'm pretty sure I was bound to be an actor from the very start. My first performances were 'radio shows' recorded on my Fisher Price tape player, while my debut public performance was an original song about David and Goliath. 
Things snowballed from there and in no time I was playing(link: http://google.com text: Friedrich) in the junior high's production of The Sound of Music. (To this day Iâ€™ve played both Friedrich and Rolf in that musical but never Kurt, ironic really.)
 In college I continued acting as a theatre major with psychology and music minors and was fortunate enough to land my first professional gig a year before I was to graduate; I played Alexander in Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad, Day. 
After graduation I continued working with various theatres in the Minneapolis area before heading back to Chicago for a short while. While in Chicago, I worked on a handful of projects, most notably the American premier of Ball at the Savoy with Chicago Folk Operetta and the subsequent Naxos cast recording. 
I am now proudly based in Los Angeles putting my skills and experience to work in Sunny California.
